This is a terrible attempt at an [antimatter dimensions](https://ivark.github.io/AntimatterDimensions/) clone for the iPhone. I am working my way from basic dimensions, to hopefully a semi-faithful recreation.

This is my first real shot at making a swift app, and its been a _learning experience_, but I welcome any and all contributions.

This was not architected, this was not thought out. I do want to learn swift/ios through this, but i am absolutely aware of my limitations in knowledge at the moment

if it looks like this was made by a web developer in his freetime without a care in the world, guess what
